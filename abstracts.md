## We are not the 99%: The Local Group in a Cosmological Context

The Milky Way and M31, the two dominant galaxies in the Local Group, have
a series of characteristics that make them an atypical pair.
Two of the most outstanding features are their kinematics and highly 
planar satellite distributions. We use these two attributes to place the 
Local Group in an explicit cosmological context provided by simulations 
performed in the Cold  Dark Matter structure formation paradigm.
In this context the Local Group turns out to be an extreme outlier at the 
current moment in cosmic history. This result can be used either to constrain 
the detailed formation history of our Galaxy or to challenge the ability of 
LCDM to describe small scale structures in the Universe.

## Boosting the Lya line in Pop III Galaxies from Stochastic IMF Sampling

The sensitivity of the Lya flux to the high-energy end of the galaxy
spectrum makes it subject to stochastic sampling of the
IMF. Stochasticity introduces a dispersion in the predicted nebular
line fluxes around the deterministic value by as much as a factor of
~4.  Stochastic sampling also affects the expected Equivalent Width
making it possible to have an EW as high as ~3 times the deterministic
value. Stochastic models seem to be required for a proper
interpretation of future distant galaxy detections to be made with
facilities such as JWST and other large, groundbased telescopes.
