## Boosting the Lya line in Pop III Galaxies from Stochastic IMF Sampling

The sensitivity of the Lya flux to the high-energy end of the galaxy
spectrum makes it subject to stochastic sampling of the
IMF. Stochasticity introduces a dispersion in the predicted nebular
line fluxes around the deterministic value by as much as a factor of
~4.  Stochastic sampling also affects the expected Equivalent Width
making it possible to have an EW as high as ~3 times the deterministic
value. Stochastic models seem to be required for a proper
interpretation of future distant galaxy detections to be made with
facilities such as JWST and other large, groundbased telescopes.
